Version 1.0 (2018-08-03) \u00b6 Major Additions to Version 1.0 \u00b6 Internal Refactor of Pages, Files, and Navigation \u00b6 Internal handling of pages, files and navigation has been completely refactored. The changes included in the refactor are summarized below. Support for hidden pages. All Markdown pages are now included in the build regardless of whether they are included in the navigation configuration (#699). The navigation can now include links to external sites (#989 #1373 & #1406). Page data (including titles) is properly determined for all pages before any page is rendered (#1347). Automatically populated navigation now sorts index pages to the top. In other words, The index page will be listed as the first child of a directory, while all other documents are sorted alphanumerically by file name after the index page (#73 & #1042). A README.md file is now treated as an index file within a directory and will be rendered to index.html (#608). The URLs for all files are computed once and stored in a files collection. This ensures all internal links are always computed correctly regardless of the configuration. This also allows all internal links to be validated, not just links to other Markdown pages. (#842 & #872). A new url template filter smartly ensures all URLs are relative to the current page (#1526). An on_files plugin event has been added, which could be used to include files not in the docs_dir , exclude files, redefine page URLs (i.e. implement extensionless URLs), or to manipulate files in various other ways. Backward Incompatible Changes \u00b6 As part of the internal refactor, a number of backward incompatible changes have been introduced, which are summarized below. URLS have changed when use_directory_urls is False \u00b6 Previously, all Markdown pages would be have their filenames altered to be index pages regardless of how the use_directory_urls setting was configured. However, the path munging is only needed when use_directory_urls is set to True (the default). The path mungling no longer happens when use_directory_urls is set to False , which will result in different URLs for all pages that were not already index files. As this behavior only effects a non-default configuration, and the most common user-case for setting the option to False is for local file system ( file:// ) browsing, its not likely to effect most users. However, if you have use_directory_urls set to False for a MkDocs site hosted on a web server, most of your URLs will now be broken. As you can see below, the new URLs are much more sensible. Markdown file Old URL New URL index.md index.html index.html foo.md foo/index.html foo.html foo/bar.md foo/bar/index.html foo/bar.html Note that there has been no change to URLs or file paths when use_directory_urls is set to True (the default), except that MkDocs more consistently includes an ending slash on all internally generated URLs. The pages configuration setting has been renamed to nav \u00b6 The pages configuration setting is deprecated and will issue a warning if set in the configuration file. The setting has been renamed nav . To update your configuration, simply rename the setting to nav . In other words, if your configuration looked like this: pages : - Home : index.md - User Guide : user-guide.md Simply edit the configuration as follows: nav : - Home : index.md - User Guide : user-guide.md In the current release, any configuration which includes a pages setting, but no nav setting, the pages configuration will be copied to nav and a warning will be issued. However, in a future release, that may no longer happen. If both pages and nav are defined, the pages setting will be ignored. Template variables and base_url \u00b6 In previous versions of MkDocs some URLs expected the base_url template variable to be prepended to the URL and others did not. That inconsistency has been removed in that no URLs are modified before being added to the template context. For example, a theme template might have previously included a link to the site_name as: <a href=\" {{ nav.homepage.url }} \"> {{ config.site_name }} </a> And MkDocs would magically return a URL for the homepage which was relative to the current page. That \"magic\" has been removed and the url template filter should be used: <a href=\" {{ nav.homepage.url | url }} \"> {{ config.site_name }} </a> This change applies to any navigation items and pages, as well as the page.next_page and page.previous_page attributes. For the time being, the extra_javascript and extra_css variables continue to work as previously (without the url template filter), but they have been deprecated and the corresponding configuration values ( config.extra_javascript and config.extra_css respectively) should be used with the filter instead. {% for path in config [ 'extra_css' ] %} <link href=\" {{ path | url }} \" rel=\"stylesheet\"> {% endfor %} Note that navigation can now include links to external sites. Obviously, the base_url should not be prepended to these items. However, the url template filter is smart enough to recognize the URL is absolute and does not alter it. Therefore, all navigation items can be passed to the filter and only those that need to will be altered. {% for nav_item in nav %} <a href=\" {{ nav_item.url | url }} \"> {{ nav_item.title }} </a> {% endfor %} Path Based Settings are Relative to Configuration File (#543) \u00b6 Previously any relative paths in the various configuration options were resolved relative to the current working directory. They are now resolved relative to the configuration file. As the documentation has always encouraged running the various MkDocs commands from the directory that contains the configuration file (project root), this change will not affect most users. However, it will make it much easier to implement automated builds or otherwise run commands from a location other than the project root. Simply use the -f/--config-file option and point it at the configuration file: mkdocs build --config-file /path/to/my/config/file.yml As previously, if no file is specified, MkDocs looks for a file named mkdocs.yml in the current working directory. Added support for YAML Meta-Data (#1542) \u00b6 Previously, MkDocs only supported MultiMarkdown style meta-data, which does not recognize different data types and is rather limited. MkDocs now also supports YAML style meta-data in Markdown documents. MkDocs relies on the the presence or absence of the deliminators ( --- or ... ) to determine whether YAML style meta-data or MultiMarkdown style meta-data is being used. Previously MkDocs would recognize MultiMarkdown style meta-data between the deliminators. Now, if the deliminators are detected, but the content between the deliminators is not valid YAML meta-data, MkDocs does not attempt to parse the content as MultiMarkdown style meta-data. Therefore, MultiMarkdowns style meta-data must not include the deliminators. See the MultiMarkdown style meta-data documentation for details. Prior to version 0.17, MkDocs returned all meta-data values as a list of strings (even a single line would return a list of one string). In version 0.17, that behavior was changed to return each value as a single string (multiple lines were joined), which some users found limiting (see #1471). That behavior continues for MultiMarkdown style meta-data in the current version. However, YAML style meta-data supports the full range of \"safe\" YAML data types. Therefore, it is recommended that any complex meta-data make use of the YAML style (see the YAML style meta-data documentation for details). In fact, a future version of MkDocs may deprecate support for MultiMarkdown style meta-data. Refactor Search Plugin \u00b6 The search plugin has been completely refactored to include support for the following features: Use a web worker in the browser with a fallback (#1396). Optionally pre-build search index locally (#859 & #1061). Upgrade to lunr.js 2.x (#1319). Support search in languages other than English (#826). Allow the user to define the word separators (#867). Only run searches for queries of length > 2 (#1127). Remove dependency on require.js (#1218). Compress the search index (#1128). Users can review the configuration options available and theme authors should review how search and themes interact. theme_dir Configuration Option fully Deprecated \u00b6 As of version 0.17, the custom_dir option replaced the deprecated theme_dir option. If users had set the theme_dir option, MkDocs version 0.17 copied the value to the theme.custom_dir option and a warning was issued. As of version 1.0, the value is no longer copied and an error is raised. Other Changes and Additions to Version 1.0 \u00b6 Keyboard shortcuts changed to not conflict with commonly used accessibility shortcuts (#1502.) User friendly YAML parse errors (#1543). Officially support Python 3.7. A missing theme configuration file now raises an error. Empty extra_css and extra_javascript settings no longer raise a warning. Add highlight.js configuration settings to built-in themes (#1284). Close search modal when result is selected (#1527). Add a level attribute to AnchorLinks (#1272). Add MkDocs version check to gh-deploy script (#640). Improve Markdown extension error messages. (#782). Drop official support for Python 3.3 and set tornado>=5.0 (#1427).

Version 0.17.4 (2018-06-08) \u00b6 Bugfix: Add multi-level nesting support to sitemap.xml (#1482).

Bugfix: Add length support to mkdocs.toc.TableOfContext (#1325). Bugfix: Add some theme specific settings to the search plugin for third party themes (#1316). Bugfix: Override site_url with dev_addr on local server (#1317). Version 0.17.0 (2017-10-19) \u00b6 Major Additions to Version 0.17.0 \u00b6 Plugin API. (#206) \u00b6 A new Plugin API has been added to MkDocs which allows users to define their own custom behaviors. See the included documentation for a full explanation of the API. The previously built-in search functionality has been removed and wrapped in a plugin (named \"search\") with no changes in behavior. When MkDocs builds, the search index is now written to search/search_index.json instead of mkdocs/search_index.json . If no plugins setting is defined in the config, then the search plugin will be included by default. See the configuration documentation for information on overriding the default. Theme Customization. (#1164) \u00b6 Support had been added to provide theme specific customizations. Theme authors can define default options as documented in Theme Configuration . A theme can now inherit from another theme, define various static templates to be rendered, and define arbitrary default variables to control behavior in the templates. The theme configuration is defined in a configuration file named mkdocs_theme.yml which should be placed at the root of your template files. A warning will be raised if no configuration file is found and an error will be raised in a future release. Users can override those defaults under the theme configuration option of their mkdocs.yml configuration file, which now accepts nested options. One such nested option is the custom_dir option, which replaces the now deprecated theme_dir option. If users had previously set the theme_dir option, a warning will be issued, with an error expected in a future release. If a configuration previously defined a theme_dir like this: theme : mkdocs theme_dir : custom Then the configuration should be adjusted as follows: theme : name : mkdocs custom_dir : custom See the theme configuration option documentation for details. Previously deprecated Template variables removed. (#1168) \u00b6 Page Template \u00b6 The primary entry point for page templates has been changed from base.html to main.html . This allows base.html to continue to exist while allowing users to override main.html and extend base.html . For version 0.16, base.html continued to work if no main.html template existed, but it raised a deprecation warning. In version 1.0, a build will fail if no main.html template exists. Context Variables \u00b6 Page specific variable names in the template context have been refactored as defined in Custom Themes . The old variable names issued a warning in version 0.16, but have been removed in version 1.0. Any of the following old page variables should be updated to the new ones in user created and third-party templates: Old Variable Name New Variable Name current_page page page_title page.title content page.content toc page.toc meta page.meta canonical_url page.canonical_url previous_page page.previous_page next_page page.next_page Additionally, a number of global variables have been altered and/or removed and user created and third-party templates should be updated as outlined below: Old Variable Name New Variable Name or Expression current_page page include_nav nav|length>1 include_next_prev (page.next_page or page.previous_page) site_name config.site_name site_author config.site_author page_description config.site_description repo_url config.repo_url repo_name config.repo_name site_url config.site_url copyright config.copyright google_analytics config.google_analytics homepage_url nav.homepage.url favicon {{ base_url }}/img/favicon.ico Auto-Populated extra_css and extra_javascript Fully Deprecated. (#986) \u00b6 In previous versions of MkDocs, if the extra_css or extra_javascript config settings were empty, MkDocs would scan the docs_dir and auto-populate each setting with all of the CSS and JavaScript files found. On version 0.16 this behavior was deprecated and a warning was issued. In 0.17 any unlisted CSS and JavaScript files will not be included in the HTML templates, however, a warning will be issued. In other words, they will still be copied to the site-dir , but they will not have any effect on the theme if they are not explicitly listed. All CSS and javaScript files in the docs_dir should be explicitly listed in the extra_css or extra_javascript config settings going forward.

(#874) \u00b6 Page Context \u00b6 Page specific variable names in the template context have been refactored as defined in Custom Themes . The old variable names will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Any of the following old page variables should be updated to the new ones in user created and third-party templates: Old Variable Name New Variable Name current_page page page_title page.title content page.content toc page.toc meta page.meta canonical_url page.canonical_url previous_page page.previous_page next_page page.next_page Global Context \u00b6 Additionally, a number of global variables have been altered and/or deprecated and user created and third-party templates should be updated as outlined below: Previously, the global variable include_nav was altered programmatically based on the number of pages in the nav. The variable will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use {% if nav|length>1 %} instead. Previously, the global variable include_next_prev was altered programmatically based on the number of pages in the nav. The variable will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use {% if page.next_page or page.previous_page %} instead. Previously the global variable page_description was altered programmatically based on whether the current page was the homepage. Now it simply maps to config['site_description'] . Use {% if page.is_homepage %} in the template to conditionally change the description. The global variable homepage_url maps directly to nav.homepage.url and is being deprecated. The variable will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use nav.homepage.url instead. The global variable favicon maps to the configuration setting site_favicon . Both the template variable and the configuration setting are being deprecated and will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, and may be removed in a future version. Use {{ base_url }}/img/favicon.ico in your template instead. Users can simply save a copy of their custom favicon icon to img/favicon.ico in either their docs_dir or theme_dir . A number of variables map directly to similarly named variables in the config . Those variables are being deprecated and will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use config.var_name instead, where var_name is the name of one of the configuration variables. Below is a summary of all of the changes made to the global context: Old Variable Name New Variable Name or Expression current_page page include_nav nav|length>1 include_next_prev (page.next_page or page.previous_page) site_name config.site_name site_author config.site_author page_description config.site_description repo_url config.repo_url repo_name config.repo_name site_url config.site_url copyright config.copyright google_analytics config.google_analytics homepage_url nav.homepage.url favicon {{ base_url }}/img/favicon.ico Increased Template Customization. (#607) \u00b6 The built-in themes have been updated by having each of their many parts wrapped in template blocks which allow each individual block to be easily overridden using the theme_dir config setting. Without any new settings, you can use a different analytics service, replace the default search function, or alter the behavior of the navigation, among other things. See the relevant documentation for more details. To enable this feature, the primary entry point for page templates has been changed from base.html to main.html . This allows base.html to continue to exist while allowing users to override main.html and extend base.html . For version 0.16, base.html will continue to work if no main.html template exists, but it is deprecated and will raise a warning. In version 1.0, a build will fail if no main.html template exists. Any custom and third party templates should be updated accordingly. The easiest way for a third party theme to be updated would be to simply add a main.html file which only contains the following line: {% extends \"base.html\" %} That way, the theme contains the main.html entry point, and also supports overriding blocks in the same manner as the built-in themes. Third party themes are encouraged to wrap the various pieces of their templates in blocks in order to support such customization. Auto-Populated extra_css and extra_javascript Deprecated. (#986) \u00b6 In previous versions of MkDocs, if the extra_css or extra_javascript config settings were empty, MkDocs would scan the docs_dir and auto-populate each setting with all of the CSS and JavaScript files found. This behavior is deprecated and a warning will be issued. In the next release, the auto-populate feature will stop working and any unlisted CSS and JavaScript files will not be included in the HTML templates. In other words, they will still be copied to the site-dir , but they will not have any effect on the theme if they are not explicitly listed. All CSS and javaScript files in the docs_dir should be explicitly listed in the extra_css or extra_javascript config settings going forward. Support for dirty builds. (#990) \u00b6 For large sites the build time required to create the pages can become problematic, thus a \"dirty\" build mode was created. This mode simply compares the modified time of the generated HTML and source markdown. If the markdown has changed since the HTML then the page is re-constructed. Otherwise, the page remains as is. This mode may be invoked in both the mkdocs serve and mkdocs build commands: mkdocs serve --dirtyreload mkdocs build --dirty It is important to note that this method for building the pages is for development of content only, since the navigation and other links do not get updated on other pages. Stricter Directory Validation \u00b6 Previously, a warning was issued if the site_dir was a child directory of the docs_dir . This now raises an error. Additionally, an error is now raised if the docs_dir is set to the directory which contains your config file rather than a child directory. You will need to rearrange you directory structure to better conform with the documented layout .

(#763) Version 0.15.0 (2016-01-21) \u00b6 Major Additions to Version 0.15.0 \u00b6 Add support for installable themes \u00b6 MkDocs now supports themes that are distributed via Python packages. With this addition, the Bootstrap and Bootswatch themes have been moved to external git repositories and python packages. See their individual documentation for more details about these specific themes. MkDocs Bootstrap MkDocs Bootswatch They will be included with MkDocs by default until a future release. After that they will be installable with pip: pip install mkdocs-bootstrap and pip install mkdocs-bootswatch See the documentation for Styling your docs for more information about using and customizing themes and Custom themes for creating and distributing new themes Other Changes and Additions to Version 0.15.0 \u00b6 Fix issues when using absolute links to Markdown files.

(#616) Version 0.13.3 (2015-06-02) \u00b6 Bugfix: Reduce validation error to a warning if the site_dir is within the docs_dir as this shouldn't cause any problems with building but will inconvenience users building multiple times. (#580) Version 0.13.2 (2015-05-30) \u00b6 Bugfix: Ensure all errors and warnings are logged before exiting. (#536) Bugfix: Fix compatibility issues with ReadTheDocs. (#554) Version 0.13.1 (2015-05-27) \u00b6 Bugfix: Fix a problem with minimal configurations which only contain a list of paths in the pages config. (#562) Version 0.13.0 (2015-05-26) \u00b6 Deprecations to Version 0.13.0 \u00b6 Deprecate the JSON command \u00b6 In this release the mkdocs json command has been marked as deprecated and when used a deprecation warning will be shown. It will be removed in a future release of MkDocs, version 1.0 at the latest. The mkdocs json command provided a convenient way for users to output the documentation contents as JSON files but with the additions of search to MkDocs this functionality is duplicated. A new index with all the contents from a MkDocs build is created in the site_dir , so with the default value for the site_dir It can be found in site/mkdocs/search_index.json . This new file is created on every MkDocs build (with mkdocs build ) and no configuration is needed to enable it. Change the pages configuration \u00b6 Provide a new way to define pages, and specifically nested pages , in the mkdocs.yml file and deprecate the existing approach, support will be removed with MkDocs 1.0. Warn users about the removal of builtin themes \u00b6 All themes other than mkdocs and readthedocs will be moved into external packages in a future release of MkDocs. This will enable them to be more easily supported and updates outside MkDocs releases. Major Additions to Version 0.13.0 \u00b6 Search \u00b6 Support for search has now been added to MkDocs. This is based on the JavaScript library lunr.js . It has been added to both the mkdocs and readthedocs themes. See the custom theme documentation on supporting search for adding it to your own themes. New Command Line Interface \u00b6 The command line interface for MkDocs has been re-written with the Python library Click . This means that MkDocs now has an easier to use interface with better help output. This change is partially backwards incompatible as while undocumented it was possible to pass any configuration option to the different commands. Now only a small subset of the configuration options can be passed to the commands. To see in full commands and available arguments use mkdocs --help and mkdocs build --help to have them displayed. Support Extra HTML and XML files \u00b6 Like the extra_javascript and extra_css configuration options, a new option named extra_templates has been added. This will automatically be populated with any .html or .xml files in the project docs directory. Users can place static HTML and XML files and they will be copied over, or they can also use Jinja2 syntax and take advantage of the global variables . By default MkDocs will use this approach to create a sitemap for the documentation. Other Changes and Additions to Version 0.13.0 \u00b6 Add support for Markdown extension configuration options .

All Markdown pages are now included in the build regardless of whether they are included in the navigation configuration (#699). The navigation can now include links to external sites (#989 #1373 & #1406). Page data (including titles) is properly determined for all pages before any page is rendered (#1347). Automatically populated navigation now sorts index pages to the top. In other words, The index page will be listed as the first child of a directory, while all other documents are sorted alphanumerically by file name after the index page (#73 & #1042). A README.md file is now treated as an index file within a directory and will be rendered to index.html (#608). The URLs for all files are computed once and stored in a files collection. This ensures all internal links are always computed correctly regardless of the configuration. This also allows all internal links to be validated, not just links to other Markdown pages. (#842 & #872). A new url template filter smartly ensures all URLs are relative to the current page (#1526). An on_files plugin event has been added, which could be used to include files not in the docs_dir , exclude files, redefine page URLs (i.e. implement extensionless URLs), or to manipulate files in various other ways.","title":"Internal Refactor of Pages, Files, and Navigation"},{"location":"about/release-notes/#backward-incompatible-changes","text":"As part of the internal refactor, a number of backward incompatible changes have been introduced, which are summarized below.","title":"Backward Incompatible Changes"},{"location":"about/release-notes/#urls-have-changed-when-use_directory_urls-is-false","text":"Previously, all Markdown pages would be have their filenames altered to be index pages regardless of how the use_directory_urls setting was configured. However, the path munging is only needed when use_directory_urls is set to True (the default). The path mungling no longer happens when use_directory_urls is set to False , which will result in different URLs for all pages that were not already index files. As this behavior only effects a non-default configuration, and the most common user-case for setting the option to False is for local file system ( file:// ) browsing, its not likely to effect most users. However, if you have use_directory_urls set to False for a MkDocs site hosted on a web server, most of your URLs will now be broken. As you can see below, the new URLs are much more sensible. Markdown file Old URL New URL index.md index.html index.html foo.md foo/index.html foo.html foo/bar.md foo/bar/index.html foo/bar.html Note that there has been no change to URLs or file paths when use_directory_urls is set to True (the default), except that MkDocs more consistently includes an ending slash on all internally generated URLs.","title":"URLS have changed when use_directory_urls is False"},{"location":"about/release-notes/#the-pages-configuration-setting-has-been-renamed-to-nav","text":"The pages configuration setting is deprecated and will issue a warning if set in the configuration file.

For example, a theme template might have previously included a link to the site_name as: <a href=\" {{ nav.homepage.url }} \"> {{ config.site_name }} </a> And MkDocs would magically return a URL for the homepage which was relative to the current page. That \"magic\" has been removed and the url template filter should be used: <a href=\" {{ nav.homepage.url | url }} \"> {{ config.site_name }} </a> This change applies to any navigation items and pages, as well as the page.next_page and page.previous_page attributes. For the time being, the extra_javascript and extra_css variables continue to work as previously (without the url template filter), but they have been deprecated and the corresponding configuration values ( config.extra_javascript and config.extra_css respectively) should be used with the filter instead. {% for path in config [ 'extra_css' ] %} <link href=\" {{ path | url }} \" rel=\"stylesheet\"> {% endfor %} Note that navigation can now include links to external sites. Obviously, the base_url should not be prepended to these items. However, the url template filter is smart enough to recognize the URL is absolute and does not alter it.

MkDocs relies on the the presence or absence of the deliminators ( --- or ... ) to determine whether YAML style meta-data or MultiMarkdown style meta-data is being used. Previously MkDocs would recognize MultiMarkdown style meta-data between the deliminators. Now, if the deliminators are detected, but the content between the deliminators is not valid YAML meta-data, MkDocs does not attempt to parse the content as MultiMarkdown style meta-data. Therefore, MultiMarkdowns style meta-data must not include the deliminators. See the MultiMarkdown style meta-data documentation for details. Prior to version 0.17, MkDocs returned all meta-data values as a list of strings (even a single line would return a list of one string). In version 0.17, that behavior was changed to return each value as a single string (multiple lines were joined), which some users found limiting (see #1471). That behavior continues for MultiMarkdown style meta-data in the current version. However, YAML style meta-data supports the full range of \"safe\" YAML data types. Therefore, it is recommended that any complex meta-data make use of the YAML style (see the YAML style meta-data documentation for details).

Introduction \u00b6 Project settings are always configured by using a YAML configuration file in the project directory named mkdocs.yml . As a minimum this configuration file must contain the site_name setting. All other settings are optional. Project information \u00b6 site_name \u00b6 This is a required setting , and should be a string that is used as the main title for the project documentation. For example: site_name : Marshmallow Generator When rendering the theme this setting will be passed as the site_name context variable. site_url \u00b6 Set the canonical URL of the site. This will add a link tag with the canonical URL to the generated HTML header. default : null repo_url \u00b6 When set, provides a link to your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...) on each page. repo_url : https://github.com/example/repository/ default : null repo_name \u00b6 When set, provides the name for the link to your repository on each page. default : 'GitHub' , 'Bitbucket' or 'GitLab' if the repo_url matches those domains, otherwise the hostname from the repo_url . edit_uri \u00b6 Path from the base repo_url to the docs directory when directly viewing a page, accounting for specifics of the repository host (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket, etc), the branch, and the docs directory itself. MkDocs concatenates repo_url and edit_uri , and appends the input path of the page. When set, and if your theme supports it, provides a link directly to the page in your source repository. This makes it easier to find and edit the source for the page. If repo_url is not set, this option is ignored. On some themes, setting this option may cause an edit link to be used in place of a repository link. Other themes may show both links. The edit_uri supports query ('?') and fragment ('#') characters. For repository hosts that use a query or a fragment to access the files, the edit_uri might be set as follows. (Note the ? and # in the URI...) # Query string example edit_uri : '?query=root/path/docs/' # Hash fragment example edit_uri : '#root/path/docs/' For other repository hosts, simply specify the relative path to the docs directory. # Query string example edit_uri : root/path/docs/ Note On a few known hosts (specifically GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab), the edit_uri is derived from the 'repo_url' and does not need to be set manually. Simply defining a repo_url will automatically populate the edit_uri configs setting. For example, for a GitHub- or GitLab-hosted repository, the edit_uri would be automatically set as edit/master/docs/ (Note the edit path and master branch). For a Bitbucket-hosted repository, the equivalent edit_uri would be automatically set as src/default/docs/ (note the src path and default branch). To use a different URI than the default (for example a different branch), simply set the edit_uri to your desired string. If you do not want any \"edit URL link\" displayed on your pages, then set edit_uri to an empty string to disable the automatic setting. Warning On GitHub and GitLab, the default \"edit\" path ( edit/master/docs/ ) opens the page in the online editor. This functionality requires that the user have and be logged in to a GitHub/GitLab account. Otherwise, the user will be redirected to a login/signup page. Alternatively, use the \"blob\" path ( blob/master/docs/ ) to open a read-only view, which supports anonymous access. default : edit/master/docs/ for GitHub and GitLab repos or src/default/docs/ for a Bitbucket repo, if repo_url matches those domains, otherwise null site_description \u00b6 Set the site description. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML header. default : null site_author \u00b6 Set the name of the author. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML header. default : null copyright \u00b6 Set the copyright information to be included in the documentation by the theme. default : null google_analytics \u00b6 Set the Google analytics tracking configuration. google_analytics : [ 'UA-36723568-3' , 'mkdocs.org' ] default : null remote_branch \u00b6 Set the remote branch to commit to when using gh-deploy to deploy to Github Pages. This option can be overridden by a command line option in gh-deploy . default : gh-pages remote_name \u00b6 Set the remote name to push to when using gh-deploy to deploy to Github Pages. This option can be overridden by a command line option in gh-deploy . default : origin Documentation layout \u00b6 nav \u00b6 This setting is used to determine the format and layout of the global navigation for the site. A minimal navigation configuration could look like this: nav : - 'index.md' - 'about.md' All paths must be relative to the mkdocs.yml configuration file. See the section on configuring pages and navigation for a more detailed breakdown, including how to create sub-sections. Navigation items may also include links to external sites. While titles are optional for internal links, they are required for external links. An external link may be a full URL or a relative URL. Any path which is not found in the files is assumed to be an external link. See the section about [Meta-Data] on how MkDocs determines the page title of a document. nav : - Introduction : 'index.md' - 'about.md' - 'Issue Tracker' : 'https://example.com/' In the above example, the first two items point to local files while the third points to an external site. However, sometimes the MkDocs site is hosted in a subdirectory of a project's site and you may want to link to other parts of the same site without including the full domain. In that case, you may use an appropriate relative URL. site_url : https://example.com/foo/ nav : - Home : '../' - 'User Guide' : 'user-guide.md' - 'Bug Tracker' : '/bugs/' In the above example, two different styles of external links are used. First note that the site_url indicates that the MkDocs site is hosted in the /foo/ subdirectory of the domain. Therefore, the Home navigation item is a relative link which steps up one level to the server root and effectively points to https://example.com/ . The Bug Tracker item uses an absolute path from the server root and effectively points to https://example.com/bugs/ . Of course, the User Guide points to a local MkDocs page. default : By default nav will contain an alphanumerically sorted, nested list of all the Markdown files found within the docs_dir and its sub-directories. Index files will always be listed first within a sub-section. Build directories \u00b6 theme \u00b6 Sets the theme and theme specific configuration of your documentation site. May be either a string or a set of key/value pairs. If a string, it must be the string name of a known installed theme. For a list of available themes visit styling your docs . An example set of key/value pairs might look something like this: theme : name : mkdocs custom_dir : my_theme_customizations/ static_templates : - sitemap.html include_sidebar : false If a set of key/value pairs, the following nested keys can be defined: name: \u00b6 The string name of a known installed theme. For a list of available themes visit styling your docs . custom_dir: \u00b6 A directory containing a custom theme. This can either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the directory containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute directory path from the root of your local file system. See styling your docs for details if you would like to tweak an existing theme. See custom themes if you would like to build your own theme from the ground up. static_templates: \u00b6 A list of templates to render as static pages. The templates must be located in either the theme's template directory or in the custom_dir defined in the theme configuration. (theme specific keywords) \u00b6 Any additional keywords supported by the theme can also be defined. See the documentation for the theme you are using for details. default : 'mkdocs' docs_dir \u00b6 The directory containing the documentation source markdown files. This can either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the directory containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute directory path from the root of your local file system. default : 'docs' site_dir \u00b6 The directory where the output HTML and other files are created. This can either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the directory containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute directory path from the root of your local file system. default : 'site' Note: If you are using source code control you will normally want to ensure that your build output files are not committed into the repository, and only keep the source files under version control. For example, if using git you might add the following line to your .gitignore file: site/ If you're using another source code control tool, you'll want to check its documentation on how to ignore specific directories. extra_css \u00b6 Set a list of CSS files in your docs_dir to be included by the theme. For example, the following example will include the extra.css file within the css subdirectory in your docs_dir . extra_css : - css/extra.css - css/second_extra.css default : [] (an empty list). extra_javascript \u00b6 Set a list of JavaScript files in your docs_dir to be included by the theme. See the example in extra_css for usage. default : [] (an empty list). extra_templates \u00b6 Set a list of templates in your docs_dir to be built by MkDocs. To see more about writing templates for MkDocs read the documentation about custom themes and specifically the section about the variables that are available to templates. See the example in extra_css for usage. default : [] (an empty list). extra \u00b6 A set of key value pairs, where the values can be any valid YAML construct, that will be passed to the template. This allows for great flexibility when creating custom themes. For example, if you are using a theme that supports displaying the project version, you can pass it to the theme like this: extra : version : 1.0 default : By default extra will be an empty key value mapping. Preview controls \u00b6 use_directory_urls \u00b6 This setting controls the style used for linking to pages within the documentation. The following table demonstrates how the URLs used on the site differ when setting use_directory_urls to true or false . Source file use_directory_urls: true use_directory_urls: false index.md / /index.html api-guide.md /api-guide/ /api-guide.html about/license.md /about/license/ /about/license.html The default style of use_directory_urls: true creates more user friendly URLs, and is usually what you'll want to use. The alternate style can occasionally be useful if you want your documentation to remain properly linked when opening pages directly from the file system, because it creates links that point directly to the target file rather than the target directory . default : true strict \u00b6 Determines how warnings are handled. Set to true to halt processing when a warning is raised. Set to false to print a warning and continue processing. default : false dev_addr \u00b6 Determines the address used when running mkdocs serve . Must be of the format IP:PORT . Allows a custom default to be set without the need to pass it through the --dev-addr option every time the mkdocs serve command is called. default : '127.0.0.1:8000' Formatting options \u00b6 markdown_extensions \u00b6 MkDocs uses the Python Markdown library to translate Markdown files into HTML. Python Markdown supports a variety of extensions that customize how pages are formatted. This setting lets you enable a list of extensions beyond the ones that MkDocs uses by default ( meta , toc , tables , and fenced_code ). For example, to enable the SmartyPants typography extension , use: markdown_extensions : - smarty Some extensions provide configuration options of their own. If you would like to set any configuration options, then you can nest a key/value mapping ( option_name: option value ) of any options that a given extension supports. See the documentation for the extension you are using to determine what options they support. For example, to enable permalinks in the (included) toc extension, use: markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : True Note that a colon ( : ) must follow the extension name ( toc ) and then on a new line the option name and value must be indented and separated by a colon. If you would like to define multiple options for a single extension, each option must be defined on a separate line: markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : True separator : \"_\" Add an additional item to the list for each extension. If you have no configuration options to set for a specific extension, then simply omit options for that extension: markdown_extensions : - smarty - toc : permalink : True - sane_lists See Also: The Python-Markdown documentation provides a list of extensions which are available out-of-the-box. For a list of configuration options available for a given extension, see the documentation for that extension. You may also install and use various third party extensions . Consult the documentation provided by those extensions for installation instructions and available configuration options. default : [] (an empty list). plugins \u00b6 A list of plugins (with optional configuration settings) to use when building the site . See the Plugins documentation for full details. If the plugins config setting is defined in the mkdocs.yml config file, then any defaults (such as search ) are ignored and you need to explicitly re-enable the defaults if you would like to continue using them: plugins : - search - your_other_plugin To completely disable all plugins, including any defaults, set the plugins setting to an empty list: plugins : [] default : ['search'] (the \"search\" plugin included with MkDocs). Search \u00b6 A search plugin is provided by default with MkDocs which uses lunr.js as a search engine. The following config options are available to alter the behavior of the search plugin: separator \u00b6 A regular expression which matches the characters used as word separators when building the index. By default whitespace and the hyphen ( - ) are used. To add the dot ( . ) as a word separator you might do this: plugins : - search : separator : '[\\s\\-\\.]+' default : '[\\s\\-]+' min_search_length \u00b6 An integer value that defines the minimum length for a search query. By default searches shorter than 3 chars in length are ignored as search result quality with short search terms is poor. However, for some use cases (such as documentation about Message Queues which might generate searches for 'MQ') it may be preferable to set a shorter limit. plugins : - search : min_search_length : 2 default : 3 lang \u00b6 A list of languages to use when building the search index as identified by their ISO 639-1 language codes. With Lunr Languages , the following languages are supported: ar : Arabic da : Danish nl : Dutch en : English fi : Finnish fr : French de : German hu : Hungarian it : Italian ja : Japanese no : Norwegian pt : Portuguese ro : Romanian ru : Russian es : Spanish sv : Swedish th : Thai tr : Turkish vi : Vietnamese You may contribute additional languages . Warning While search does support using multiple languages together, it is best not to add additional languages unless you really need them. Each additional language adds significant bandwidth requirements and uses more browser resources. Generally it is best to keep each instance of MkDocs to a single language. Note Lunr Languages does not currently include support for Chinese or other Asian languages. However, some users have reported decent results using Japanese. default : ['en'] prebuild_index \u00b6 Optionally generates a pre-built index of all pages, which provides some performance improvements for larger sites. Before enabling, check that the theme you are using explicitly supports using a prebuilt index (the builtin themes do). There are two options for prebuilding the index: Using Node.js setting prebuild_index to True or node . This option requires that Node.js be installed and the command node be on the system path. If this feature is enabled and fails for any reason, a warning is issued. You may use the --strict flag when building to cause such a failure to raise an error instead.

MkDocs concatenates repo_url and edit_uri , and appends the input path of the page. When set, and if your theme supports it, provides a link directly to the page in your source repository. This makes it easier to find and edit the source for the page. If repo_url is not set, this option is ignored. On some themes, setting this option may cause an edit link to be used in place of a repository link. Other themes may show both links. The edit_uri supports query ('?') and fragment ('#') characters. For repository hosts that use a query or a fragment to access the files, the edit_uri might be set as follows. (Note the ? and # in the URI...) # Query string example edit_uri : '?query=root/path/docs/' # Hash fragment example edit_uri : '#root/path/docs/' For other repository hosts, simply specify the relative path to the docs directory. # Query string example edit_uri : root/path/docs/ Note On a few known hosts (specifically GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab), the edit_uri is derived from the 'repo_url' and does not need to be set manually. Simply defining a repo_url will automatically populate the edit_uri configs setting. For example, for a GitHub- or GitLab-hosted repository, the edit_uri would be automatically set as edit/master/docs/ (Note the edit path and master branch). For a Bitbucket-hosted repository, the equivalent edit_uri would be automatically set as src/default/docs/ (note the src path and default branch). To use a different URI than the default (for example a different branch), simply set the edit_uri to your desired string. If you do not want any \"edit URL link\" displayed on your pages, then set edit_uri to an empty string to disable the automatic setting.

A minimal navigation configuration could look like this: nav : - 'index.md' - 'about.md' All paths must be relative to the mkdocs.yml configuration file. See the section on configuring pages and navigation for a more detailed breakdown, including how to create sub-sections. Navigation items may also include links to external sites. While titles are optional for internal links, they are required for external links. An external link may be a full URL or a relative URL. Any path which is not found in the files is assumed to be an external link. See the section about [Meta-Data] on how MkDocs determines the page title of a document. nav : - Introduction : 'index.md' - 'about.md' - 'Issue Tracker' : 'https://example.com/' In the above example, the first two items point to local files while the third points to an external site. However, sometimes the MkDocs site is hosted in a subdirectory of a project's site and you may want to link to other parts of the same site without including the full domain. In that case, you may use an appropriate relative URL. site_url : https://example.com/foo/ nav : - Home : '../' - 'User Guide' : 'user-guide.md' - 'Bug Tracker' : '/bugs/' In the above example, two different styles of external links are used. First note that the site_url indicates that the MkDocs site is hosted in the /foo/ subdirectory of the domain. Therefore, the Home navigation item is a relative link which steps up one level to the server root and effectively points to https://example.com/ . The Bug Tracker item uses an absolute path from the server root and effectively points to https://example.com/bugs/ .

Note If you are looking for third party themes, they are listed in the MkDocs community wiki . If you want to share a theme you create, you should list it on the Wiki. When creating a new theme, you can either follow the steps in this guide to create one from scratch or you can download the mkdocs-basic-theme as a basic, yet complete, theme with all the boilerplate required. You can find this base theme on GitHub . It contains detailed comments in the code to describe the different features and their usage. Creating a custom theme \u00b6 The bare minimum required for a custom theme is a main.html Jinja2 template file which is placed in a directory that is not a child of the docs_dir . Within mkdocs.yml , set the theme. custom_dir option to the path of the directory containing main.html . The path should be relative to the configuration file. For example, given this example project layout: mkdocs.yml docs/ index.md about.md custom_theme/ main.html ... ... you would include the following settings in mkdocs.yml to use the custom theme directory: theme : name : null custom_dir : 'custom_theme/' Note Generally, when building your own custom theme, the theme. name configuration setting would be set to null . However, if the theme. custom_dir configuration value is used in combination with an existing theme, the theme. custom_dir can be used to replace only specific parts of a built-in theme. For example, with the above layout and if you set name: \"mkdocs\" then the main.html file in the theme. custom_dir would replace the file of the same name in the mkdocs theme but otherwise the mkdocs theme would remain unchanged. This is useful if you want to make small adjustments to an existing theme. For more specific information, see styling your docs . Warning A theme's configuration defined in a mkdocs_theme.yml file is not loaded from theme.custom_dir . When an entire theme exists in theme.custom_dir and theme.name is set to null , then the entire theme configuration must be defined in the theme configuration option in the mkdocs.yml file. However, when a theme is packaged up for distribution, and loaded using the theme.name configuration option, then a mkdocs_theme.yml file is required for the theme. Basic theme \u00b6 The simplest main.html file is the following: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title> {% if page.title %}{{ page.title }} - {% endif %}{{ config.site_name }} </title> </head> <body> {{ page.content }} </body> </html> The body content from each page specified in mkdocs.yml is inserted using the {{ page.content }} tag. Style-sheets and scripts can be brought into this theme as with a normal HTML file. Navbars and tables of contents can also be generated and included automatically, through the nav and toc objects, respectively. If you wish to write your own theme, it is recommended to start with one of the built-in themes and modify it accordingly. Note As MkDocs uses Jinja as its template engine, you have access to all the power of Jinja, including template inheritance . You may notice that the themes included with MkDocs make extensive use of template inheritance and blocks, allowing users to easily override small bits and pieces of the templates from the theme custom_dir . Therefore, the built-in themes are implemented in a base.html file, which main.html extends. Although not required, third party template authors are encouraged to follow a similar pattern and may want to define the same blocks as are used in the built-in themes for consistency. Theme Files \u00b6 There are various files which a theme treats special in some way. Any other files are simply copied from the theme directory to the same path in the site_dir when the site it built. For example image and CSS files have no special significance and are copied as-is. Note, however, that if the user provides a file with the same path in their docs_dir , then the user's file will replace the theme file. Template Files \u00b6 Any files with the .html extension are considered to be template files and are not copied from the theme directory or any subdirectories. Also, any files listed in static_templates are treated as templates regardless of their file extension. Theme Meta Files \u00b6 The various files required for packaging a theme are also ignored. Specifically, the mkdocs_theme.yml configuration file and any Python files. Dot Files \u00b6 Theme authors can explicitly force MkDocs to ignore files by starting a file or directory name with a dot. Any of the following files would be ignored: .ignored.txt .ignored/file.txt foo/.ignored.txt foo/.ignored/file.txt Documentation Files \u00b6 All documentation files are ignored. Specifically, any Markdown files (using any of the file extensions supported by MKDocs). Additionally, any README files which may exist in the theme directories are ignored. Template Variables \u00b6 Each template in a theme is built with a template context. These are the variables that are available to themes. The context varies depending on the template that is being built. At the moment templates are either built with the global context or with a page specific context. The global context is used for HTML pages that don't represent an individual Markdown document, for example a 404.html page or search.html. Global Context \u00b6 The following variables are available globally on any template. config \u00b6 The config variable is an instance of MkDocs' config object generated from the mkdocs.yml config file. While you can use any config option, some commonly used options include: config.site_name config.site_url config.site_author config.site_description config.extra_javascript config.extra_css config.repo_url config.repo_name config.copyright config.google_analytics nav \u00b6 The nav variable is used to create the navigation for the documentation. The nav object is an iterable of navigation objects as defined by the nav configuration setting. In addition to the iterable of navigation objects , the nav object contains the following attributes: nav.homepage \u00b6 The page object for the homepage of the site. nav.pages \u00b6 A flat list of all page objects contained in the navigation. This list is not necessarily a complete list of all site pages as it does not contain pages which are not included in the navigation. This list does match the list and order of pages used for all \"next page\" and \"previous page\" links. For a list of all pages, use the pages template variable. Nav Example \u00b6 Following is a basic usage example which outputs the first and second level navigation as a nested list. {% if nav | length > 1 %} <ul> {% for nav_item in nav %} {% if nav_item.children %} <li> {{ nav_item.title }} <ul> {% for nav_item in nav_item.children %} <li class=\" {% if nav_item.active %} current {% endif %} \"> <a href=\" {{ nav_item.url | url }} \"> {{ nav_item.title }} </a> </li> {% endfor %} </ul> </li> {% else %} <li class=\" {% if nav_item.active %} current {% endif %} \"> <a href=\" {{ nav_item.url | url }} \"> {{ nav_item.title }} </a> </li> {% endif %} {% endfor %} </ul> {% endif %} base_url \u00b6 The base_url provides a relative path to the root of the MkDocs project. While this can be used directly by prepending it to a local relative URL, it is best to use the url template filter, which is smarter about how it applies base_url . mkdocs_version \u00b6 Contains the current MkDocs version. build_date_utc \u00b6 A Python datetime object that represents the date and time the documentation was built in UTC. This is useful for showing how recently the documentation was updated. pages \u00b6 A list of page objects including all pages in the project. The list is a flat list with all pages sorted alphanumerically by directory and file name. Note that index pages sort to the top within a directory. This list can contain pages not included in the global navigation and may not match the order of pages within that navigation. page \u00b6 In templates which are not rendered from a Markdown source file, the page variable is None . In templates which are rendered from a Markdown source file, the page variable contains a page object. The same page objects are used as page navigation objects in the global navigation and in the pages template variable. All page objects contain the following attributes: page.title \u00b6 Contains the Title for the current page. page.content \u00b6 The rendered Markdown as HTML, this is the contents of the documentation. page.toc \u00b6 An iterable object representing the Table of contents for a page. Each item in the toc is an AnchorLink which contains the following attributes: AnchorLink.title : The text of the item. AnchorLink.url : The hash fragment of a URL pointing to the item. AnchorLink.level : The zero-based level of the item. AnchorLink.children : An iterable of any child items. The following example would display the top two levels of the Table of Contents for a page. <ul> {% for toc_item in page.toc %} <li><a href=\" {{ toc_item.url }} \"> {{ toc_item.title }} </a></li> {% for toc_item in toc_item.children %} <li><a href=\" {{ toc_item.url }} \"> {{ toc_item.title }} </a></li> {% endfor %} {% endfor %} </ul> page.meta \u00b6 A mapping of the metadata included at the top of the markdown page. In this example we define a source property above the page title. source : generics . py mixins . py # Page title Content ... A template can access this metadata for the page with the meta.source variable. This could then be used to link to source files related to the documentation page. {% for filename in page.meta.source %} <a class=\"github\" href=\"https://github.com/.../ {{ filename }} \"> <span class=\"label label-info\"> {{ filename }} </span> </a> {% endfor %} page.url \u00b6 The URL of the page relative to the MkDocs site_dir . It is expected that this be used with the url filter to ensure the URL is relative to the current page. <a href=\" {{ page.url | url }} \"> {{ page.title }} </a> page.abs_url \u00b6 The absolute URL of the page from the server root as determined by the value assigned to the site_url configuration setting. The value includes any subdirectory included in the site_url , but not the domain. base_url should not be used with this variable. For example, if site_url: https://example.com/ , then the value of page.abs_url for the page foo.md would be /foo/ . However, if site_url: https://example.com/bar/ , then the value of page.abs_url for the page foo.md would be /bar/foo/ . page.canonical_url \u00b6 The full, canonical URL to the current page as determined by the value assigned to the site_url configuration setting. The value includes the domain and any subdirectory included in the site_url . base_url should not be used with this variable. page.edit_url \u00b6 The full URL to the source page in the source repository. Typically used to provide a link to edit the source page. base_url should not be used with this variable. page.is_homepage \u00b6 Evaluates to True for the homepage of the site and False for all other pages. This can be used in conjunction with other attributes of the page object to alter the behavior. For example, to display a different title on the homepage: {% if not page.is_homepage %}{{ page.title }} - {% endif %}{{ site_name }} page.previous_page \u00b6 The page object for the previous page or None . The value will be None if the current page is the first item in the site navigation or if the current page is not included in the navigation at all. When the value is a page object, the usage is the same as for page . page.next_page \u00b6 The page object for the next page or None . The value will be None if the current page is the last item in the site navigation or if the current page is not included in the navigation at all. When the value is a page object, the usage is the same as for page . page.parent \u00b6 The immediate parent of the page in the site navigation . None if the page is at the top level. page.children \u00b6 Pages do not contain children and the attribute is always None . page.active \u00b6 When True , indicates that this page is the currently viewed page. Defaults to False . page.is_section \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"section\" object. Always False for page objects. page.is_page \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"page\" object. Always True for page objects. page.is_link \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"link\" object. Always False for page objects. Navigation Objects \u00b6 Navigation objects contained in the nav template variable may be one of section objects, page objects, and link objects. While section objects may contain nested navigation objects, pages and links do not. Page objects are the full page object as used for the current page with all of the same attributes available. Section and Link objects contain a subset of those attributes as defined below: Section \u00b6 A section navigation object defines a named section in the navigation and contains a list of child navigation objects. Note that sections do not contain URLs and are not links of any kind. However, by default, MkDocs sorts index pages to the top and the first child might be used as the URL for a section if a theme choses to do so. The following attributes are available on section objects: section.title \u00b6 The title of the section. section.parent \u00b6 The immediate parent of the section or None if the section is at the top level. section.children \u00b6 An iterable of all child navigation objects. Children may include nested sections, pages and links. section.active \u00b6 When True , indicates that a child page of this section is the current page and can be used to highlight the section as the currently viewed section. Defaults to False . section.is_section \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"section\" object. Always True for section objects. section.is_page \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"page\" object. Always False for section objects. section.is_link \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"link\" object. Always False for section objects. Link \u00b6 A link navigation object contains a link which does not point to an internal MkDocs page. The following attributes are available on link objects: link.title \u00b6 The title of the link. This would generally be used as the label of the link. link.url \u00b6 The URL that the link points to. The URL should always be an absolute URLs and should not need to have base_url prepened. link.parent \u00b6 The immediate parent of the link. None if the link is at the top level. link.children \u00b6 Links do not contain children and the attribute is always None . link.active \u00b6 External links cannot be \"active\" and the attribute is always False . link.is_section \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"section\" object. Always False for link objects. link.is_page \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"page\" object. Always False for link objects. link.is_link \u00b6 Indicates that the navigation object is a \"link\" object. Always True for link objects. Extra Context \u00b6 Additional variables can be passed to the template with the extra configuration option. This is a set of key value pairs that can make custom templates far more flexible. For example, this could be used to include the project version of all pages and a list of links related to the project. This can be achieved with the following extra configuration: extra : version : 0.13.0 links : - https://github.com/mkdocs - https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/builds.html#mkdocs - https://www.mkdocs.org/ And then displayed with this HTML in the custom theme. {{ config.extra.version }} {% if config.extra.links %} <ul> {% for link in config.extra.links %} <li> {{ link }} </li> {% endfor %} </ul> {% endif %} Template Filters \u00b6 In addition to Jinja's default filters, the following custom filters are available to use in MkDocs templates: url \u00b6 Normalizes a URL. Absolute URLs are passed through unaltered. If the URL is relative and the template context includes a page object, then the URL is returned relative to the page object. Otherwise, the URL is returned with base_url prepended. <a href=\" {{ page.url | url }} \"> {{ page.title }} </a> tojson \u00b6 Safety convert a Python object to a value in a JavaScript script. <script> var mkdocs_page_name = {{ page.title | tojson | safe }} ; </script> Search and themes \u00b6 As of MkDocs version 0.17 client side search support has been added to MkDocs via the search plugin. A theme needs to provide a few things for the plugin to work with the theme. While the search plugin is activated by default, users can disable the plugin and themes should account for this. It is recommended that theme templates wrap search specific markup with a check for the plugin: {% if 'search' in config [ 'plugins' ] %} search stuff here... {% endif %} At its most basic functionality, the search plugin will simply provide an index file which is no more than a JSON file containing the content of all pages. The theme would need to implement its own search functionality client-side. However, with a few settings and the necessary templates, the plugin can provide a complete functioning client-side search tool based on lunr.js . The following HTML needs to be added to the theme so that the provided JavaScript is able to properly load the search scripts and make relative links to the search results from the current page. <script>var base_url = ' {{ base_url }} ';</script> With properly configured settings, the following HTML in a template will add a full search implementation to your theme. <h1 id=\"search\">Search Results</h1> <form action=\"search.html\"> <input name=\"q\" id=\"mkdocs-search-query\" type=\"text\" > </form> <div id=\"mkdocs-search-results\"> Sorry, page not found. </div> The JavaScript in the plugin works by looking for the specific ID's used in the above HTML. The form input for the user to type the search query must be identified with id=\"mkdocs-search-query\" and the div where the results will be placed must be identified with id=\"mkdocs-search-results\" . The plugin supports the following options being set in the theme's configuration file , mkdocs_theme.yml : include_search_page \u00b6 Determines whether the search plugin expects the theme to provide a dedicated search page via a template located at search/search.html . When include_search_page is set to true , the search template will be built and available at search/search.html . This method is used by the readthedocs theme. When include_search_page is set to false or not defined, it is expected that the theme provide some other mechanisms for displaying search results. For example, the mkdocs theme displays results on any page via a modal. search_index_only \u00b6 Determines whether the search plugin should only generate a search index or a complete search solution. When search_index_only is set to false , then the search plugin modifies the Jinja environment by adding its own templates directory (with a lower precedence than the theme) and adds its scripts to the extra_javascript config setting. When search_index_only is set to true or not defined, the search plugin makes no modifications to the Jinja environment. A complete solution using the provided index file is the responsibility of the theme. The search index is written to a JSON file at search/search_index.json in the site_dir . The JSON object contained within the file may contain up to three objects. { config: {... } , data: [ ... ] , index: { ... } } If present, the config object contains the key/value pairs of config options defined for the plugin in the user's mkdocs.yml config file under plugings.search . The config object was new in MkDocs version 1.0 . The data object contains a list of document objects. Each document object is made up of a location (URL), a title , and text which can be used to create a search index and/or display search results. If present, the index object contains a pre-built index which offers performance improvements for larger sites. Note that the pre-built index is only created if the user explicitly enables the prebuild_index config option. Themes should expect the index to not be present, but can choose to use the index when it is available. The index object was new in MkDocs version 1.0 . Packaging Themes \u00b6 MkDocs makes use of Python packaging to distribute themes. This comes with a few requirements. To see an example of a package containing one theme, see the MkDocs Bootstrap theme and to see a package that contains many themes, see the MkDocs Bootswatch theme . Note It is not strictly necessary to package a theme, as the entire theme can be contained in the custom_dir . If you have created a \"one-off theme,\" that should be sufficient. However, if you intend to distribute your theme for others to use, packaging the theme has some advantages. By packaging your theme, your users can more easily install it, they can rely on a default configuration being defined, and they can then take advantage of the custom_dir to make tweaks to your theme to better suit their needs. Package Layout \u00b6 The following layout is recommended for themes. Two files at the top level directory called MANIFEST.in and setup.py beside the theme directory which contains an empty __init__.py file, a theme configuration file ( mkdocs-theme.yml ), and your template and media files. . |-- MANIFEST.in |-- theme_name | |-- __init__.py | |-- mkdocs-theme.yml | |-- main.html | |-- styles.css `-- setup.py The MANIFEST.in file should contain the following contents but with theme_name updated and any extra file extensions added to the include. recursive - include theme_name * . ico * . js * . css * . png * . html * . eot * . svg * . ttf * . woff recursive - exclude * __pycache__ recursive - exclude * * . py [ co ] The setup.py should include the following text with the modifications described below. from setuptools import setup , find_packages VERSION = '0.0.1' setup ( name = \"mkdocs-themename\" , version = VERSION , url = '' , license = '' , description = '' , author = '' , author_email = '' , packages = find_packages (), include_package_data = True , entry_points = { 'mkdocs.themes' : [ 'themename = theme_name' , ] }, zip_safe = False ) Fill in the URL, license, description, author and author email address. The name should follow the convention mkdocs-themename (like mkdocs- bootstrap and mkdocs-bootswatch ), starting with MkDocs, using hyphens to separate words and including the name of your theme. Most of the rest of the file can be left unedited. The last section we need to change is the entry_points. This is how MkDocs finds the theme(s) you are including in the package. The name on the left is the one that users will use in their mkdocs.yml and the one on the right is the directory containing your theme files. The directory you created at the start of this section with the main.html file should contain all of the other theme files. The minimum requirement is that it includes a main.html for the theme. It must also include a __init__.py file which should be empty, this file tells Python that the directory is a package. Theme Configuration \u00b6 A packaged theme is required to include a configuration file named mkdocs_theme.yml which is placed in the root of your template files. The file should contain default configuration options for the theme. However, if the theme offers no configuration options, the file is still required and can be left blank. A theme which is not packaged does not need a mkdocs_theme.yml file as that file is not loaded from theme.custom_dir . The theme author is free to define any arbitrary options deemed necessary and those options will be made available in the templates to control behavior. For example, a theme might want to make a sidebar optional and include the following in the mkdocs_theme.yml file: show_sidebar : true Then in a template, that config option could be referenced: {% if config.theme.show_sidebar %} <div id=\"sidebar\">...</div> {% endif %} And the user could override the default in their project's mkdocs.yml config file: theme : name : themename show_sidebar : false In addition to arbitrary options defined by the theme, MkDocs defines a few special options which alters its behavior: static_templates \u00b6 This option mirrors the theme config option of the same name and allows some defaults to be set by the theme. Note that while the user can add templates to this list, the user cannot remove templates included in the theme's config. extends \u00b6 Defines a parent theme that this theme inherits from. The value should be the string name of the parent theme. Normal Jinja inheritance rules apply. Plugins may also define some options which allow the theme to inform a plugin about which set of plugin options it expects. See the documentation for any plugins you may wish to support in your theme. Distributing Themes \u00b6 With the above changes, your theme should now be ready to install. This can be done with pip, using pip install . if you are still in the same directory as the setup.py. Most Python packages, including MkDocs, are distributed on PyPI. To do this, you should run the following command. python setup.py register If you don't have an account setup, you should be prompted to create one. For a much more detailed guide, see the official Python packaging documentation for Packaging and Distributing Projects .","title":"Custom themes"},{"location":"user-guide/custom-themes/#custom-themes","text":"A guide to creating and distributing custom themes.

Within mkdocs.yml , set the theme. custom_dir option to the path of the directory containing main.html . The path should be relative to the configuration file. For example, given this example project layout: mkdocs.yml docs/ index.md about.md custom_theme/ main.html ... ... you would include the following settings in mkdocs.yml to use the custom theme directory: theme : name : null custom_dir : 'custom_theme/' Note Generally, when building your own custom theme, the theme. name configuration setting would be set to null . However, if the theme. custom_dir configuration value is used in combination with an existing theme, the theme. custom_dir can be used to replace only specific parts of a built-in theme. For example, with the above layout and if you set name: \"mkdocs\" then the main.html file in the theme. custom_dir would replace the file of the same name in the mkdocs theme but otherwise the mkdocs theme would remain unchanged. This is useful if you want to make small adjustments to an existing theme. For more specific information, see styling your docs . Warning A theme's configuration defined in a mkdocs_theme.yml file is not loaded from theme.custom_dir . When an entire theme exists in theme.custom_dir and theme.name is set to null , then the entire theme configuration must be defined in the theme configuration option in the mkdocs.yml file.

Style-sheets and scripts can be brought into this theme as with a normal HTML file. Navbars and tables of contents can also be generated and included automatically, through the nav and toc objects, respectively. If you wish to write your own theme, it is recommended to start with one of the built-in themes and modify it accordingly. Note As MkDocs uses Jinja as its template engine, you have access to all the power of Jinja, including template inheritance . You may notice that the themes included with MkDocs make extensive use of template inheritance and blocks, allowing users to easily override small bits and pieces of the templates from the theme custom_dir . Therefore, the built-in themes are implemented in a base.html file, which main.html extends.

The form input for the user to type the search query must be identified with id=\"mkdocs-search-query\" and the div where the results will be placed must be identified with id=\"mkdocs-search-results\" .

However, if you intend to distribute your theme for others to use, packaging the theme has some advantages.

The directory you created at the start of this section with the main.html file should contain all of the other theme files. The minimum requirement is that it includes a main.html for the theme.

There are two basic types of GitHub Pages sites: Project Pages sites, and User and Organization Pages sites. They are nearly identical but have some important differences, which require a different work flow when deploying. Project Pages \u00b6 Project Pages sites are simpler as the site files get deployed to a branch within the project repository ( gh-pages by default). After you checkout the primary working branch (usually master ) of the git repository where you maintain the source documentation for your project, run the following command: mkdocs gh-deploy That's it! Behind the scenes, MkDocs will build your docs and use the ghp-import tool to commit them to the gh-pages branch and push the gh-pages branch to GitHub. Use mkdocs gh-deploy --help to get a full list of options available for the gh-deploy command. Be aware that you will not be able to review the built site before it is pushed to GitHub. Therefore, you may want to verify any changes you make to the docs beforehand by using the build or serve commands and reviewing the built files locally. Warning You should never edit files in your pages repository by hand if you're using the gh-deploy command because you will lose your work the next time you run the command. Organization and User Pages \u00b6 User and Organization Pages sites are not tied to a specific project, and the site files are deployed to the master branch in a dedicated repository named with the GitHub account name. Therefore, you need working copies of two repositories on our local system. For example, consider the following file structure: my-project/ mkdocs.yml docs/ orgname.github.io/ After making and verifying updates to your project you need to change directories to the orgname.github.io repository and call the mkdocs gh-deploy command from there: cd ../orgname.github.io/ mkdocs gh-deploy --config-file ../my-project/mkdocs.yml --remote-branch master Note that you need to explicitly point to the mkdocs.yml configuration file as it is no longer in the current working directory. You also need to inform the deploy script to commit to the master branch. You may override the default with the remote_branch configuration setting, but if you forget to change directories before running the deploy script, it will commit to the master branch of your project, which you probably don't want. Be aware that you will not be able to review the built site before it is pushed to GitHub. Therefore, you may want to verify any changes you make to the docs beforehand by using the build or serve commands and reviewing the built files locally. Warning You should never edit files in your pages repository by hand if you're using the gh-deploy command because you will lose your work the next time you run the command. Custom Domains \u00b6 GitHub Pages includes support for using a Custom Domain for your site. In addition to the steps documented by GitHub, you need to take one additional step so that MkDocs will work with your custom domain. You need to add a CNAME file to the root of your docs_dir . The file must contain a single bare domain or subdomain on a single line (see MkDocs' own CNAME file as an example). You may create the file manually, or use GitHub's web interface to set up the custom domain (under Settings / Custom Domain). If you use the web interface, GitHub will create the CNAME file for you and save it to the root of your \"pages\" branch. So that the file does not get removed the next time you deploy, you need to copy the file to your docs_dir . With the file properly included in your docs_dir , MkDocs will include the file in your built site and push it to your \"pages\" branch each time you run the gh-deploy command. If you are having problems getting a custom domain to work, see GitHub's documentation on Troubleshooting custom domains . Read the Docs \u00b6 Read the Docs offers free documentation hosting. You can import your docs using any major version control system, including Mercurial, Git, Subversion, and Bazaar. Read the Docs supports MkDocs out-of-the-box. Follow the instructions on their site to arrange the files in your repository properly, create an account and point it at your publicly hosted repository. If properly configured, your documentation will update each time you push commits to your public repository. Note To benefit from all of the features offered by Read the Docs, you will need to use the Read the Docs theme which ships with MkDocs. The various themes which may be referenced in Read the Docs' documentation are Sphinx specific themes and will not work with MkDocs. Other Providers \u00b6 Any hosting provider which can serve static files can be used to serve documentation generated by MkDocs. While it would be impossible to document how to upload the docs to every hosting provider out there, the following guidelines should provide some general assistance. When you build your site (using the mkdocs build command), all of the files are written to the directory assigned to the site_dir configuration option (defaults to \"site\" ) in your mkdocs.yaml config file. Generally, you will simply need to copy the contents of that directory to the root directory of your hosting provider's server. Depending on your hosting provider's setup, you may need to use a graphical or command line ftp , ssh or scp client to transfer the files. For example, a typical set of commands from the command line might look something like this: mkdocs build scp -r ./site user@host:/path/to/server/root Of course, you will need to replace user with the username you have with your hosting provider and host with the appropriate domain name. Additionally, you will need to adjust the /path/to/server/root to match the configuration of your hosts' file system. See your host's documentation for specifics. You will likely want to search their documentation for \"ftp\" or \"uploading site\". 404 Pages \u00b6 When MkDocs builds the documentation it will include a 404.html file in the build directory . This file will be automatically used when deploying to GitHub but only on a custom domain. Other web servers may be configured to use it but the feature won't always be available.

If you are using a plugin which comes with MkDocs, then it was installed when you installed MkDocs. However, to install third party plugins, you need to determine the appropriate package name and install it using pip : pip install mkdocs-foo-plugin Once a plugin has been successfully installed, it is ready to use. It just needs to be enabled in the configuration file. The MkDocs Plugins wiki page has a growing list of plugins that you can install and use. Using Plugins \u00b6 The plugins configuration option should contain a list of plugins to use when building the site. Each \"plugin\" must be a string name assigned to the plugin (see the documentation for a given plugin to determine its \"name\"). A plugin listed here must already be installed . plugins : - search Some plugins may provide configuration options of their own. If you would like to set any configuration options, then you can nest a key/value mapping ( option_name: option value ) of any options that a given plugin supports. Note that a colon ( : ) must follow the plugin name and then on a new line the option name and value must be indented and separated by a colon. If you would like to define multiple options for a single plugin, each option must be defined on a separate line. plugins : - search : lang : en foo : bar For information regarding the configuration options available for a given plugin, see that plugin's documentation. For a list of default plugins and how to override them, see the configuration documentation. Developing Plugins \u00b6 Like MkDocs, plugins must be written in Python. It is generally expected that each plugin would be distributed as a separate Python module, although it is possible to define multiple plugins in the same module. At a minimum, a MkDocs Plugin must consist of a BasePlugin subclass and an entry point which points to it. BasePlugin \u00b6 A subclass of mkdocs.plugins.BasePlugin should define the behavior of the plugin. The class generally consists of actions to perform on specific events in the build process as well as a configuration scheme for the plugin. All BasePlugin subclasses contain the following attributes: config_scheme \u00b6 : A tuple of configuration validation instances. Each item must consist of a two item tuple in which the first item is the string name of the configuration option and the second item is an instance of mkdocs.config.config_options.BaseConfigOption or any of its subclasses. For example , the following `config_scheme` defines three configuration options : `foo` , which accepts a string ; `bar` , which accepts an integer ; and `baz` , which accepts a boolean value . class MyPlugin ( mkdocs . plugins . BasePlugin ): config_scheme = ( ( 'foo' , mkdocs . config . config_options . Type ( str , default = 'a default value' )), ( 'bar' , mkdocs . config . config_options . Type ( int , default = 0 )), ( 'baz' , mkdocs . config . config_options . Type ( bool , default = True )) ) When the user ' s configuration is loaded , the above scheme will be used to validate the configuration and fill in any defaults for settings not provided by the user . The validation classes may be any of the classes provided in `mkdocs.config.config_options` or a third party subclass defined in the plugin . Any settings provided by the user which fail validation or are not defined in the `config_scheme` will raise a `mkdocs.config.base.ValidationError` . config \u00b6 : A dictionary of configuration options for the plugin, which is populated by the load_config method after configuration validation has completed. Use this attribute to access options provided by the user. def on_pre_build(self, config): if self.config['bool_option']: # implement \"bool_option\" functionality here... All BasePlugin subclasses contain the following method(s): load_config(options) \u00b6 : Loads configuration from a dictionary of options. Returns a tuple of (errors, warnings) . This method is called by MkDocs during configuration validation and should not need to be called by the plugin. on_<event_name>() \u00b6 : Optional methods which define the behavior for specific events . The plugin should define its behavior within these methods. Replace <event_name> with the actual name of the event. For example, the pre_build event would be defined in the on_pre_build method. Most events accept one positional argument and various keyword arguments . It is generally expected that the positional argument would be modified ( or replaced ) by the plugin and returned . If nothing is returned ( the method returns `None` ), then the original , unmodified object is used . The keyword arguments are simply provided to give context and / or supply data which may be used to determine how the positional argument should be modified . It is good practice to accept keyword arguments as `**kwargs` . In the event that additional keywords are provided to an event in a future version of MkDocs , there will be no need to alter your plugin . For example , the following event would add an additional static_template to the theme config : class MyPlugin ( BasePlugin ): def on_config ( self , config , ** kwargs ): config [ 'theme' ]. static_templates . add ( 'my_template.html' ) return config Events \u00b6 There are three kinds of events: Global Events , Page Events and Template Events . Global Events \u00b6 Global events are called once per build at either the beginning or end of the build process. Any changes made in these events will have a global effect on the entire site. on_serve \u00b6 : The serve event is only called when the serve command is used during development. It is passed the Server instance which can be modified before it is activated. For example, additional files or directories could be added to the list of \"watched\" files for auto-reloading. Parameters : : __server : __ ` livereload . Server ` instance : __config : __ global configuration object : __builder : __ a callable which gets passed to each call to ` server . watch ` Returns : : ` livereload . Server ` instance on_config \u00b6 : The config event is the first event called on build and is run immediately after the user configuration is loaded and validated. Any alterations to the config should be made here. Parameters : : __config : __ global configuration object Returns : : global configuration object on_pre_build \u00b6 : The pre_build event does not alter any variables. Use this event to call pre-build scripts. Parameters: : __config:__ global configuration object on_files \u00b6 : The files event is called after the files collection is populated from the docs_dir . Use this event to add, remove, or alter files in the collection. Note that Page objects have not yet been associated with the file objects in the collection. Use Page Events to manipulate page specific data.

Default: 78 (n) previous : Navigate to the \"previous\" page. Default: 80 (p) search : Display the search modal. Default: 83 (s) navigation_depth : The maximum depth of the navigation tree in the sidebar. Default: 2 . nav_style : This adjusts the visual style for the top navigation bar; by default, this is set to primary (the default), but it can also be set to dark or light . theme : name : mkdocs nav_style : dark readthedocs \u00b6 A clone of the default theme used by the Read the Docs service, which offers the same restricted feature-set as its parent theme. Like its parent theme, only two levels of navigation are supported. In addition to the default theme configuration options , the readthedocs theme supports the following options: highlightjs : Enables highlighting of source code in code blocks using the highlight.js JavaScript library. Default: True . hljs_languages : By default, highlight.js only supports 23 common languages. List additional languages here to include support for them. theme : name : readthedocs highlightjs : true hljs_languages : - yaml - rust include_homepage_in_sidebar : Lists the homepage in the sidebar menu. As MkDocs requires that the homepage be listed in the nav configuration option, this setting allows the homepage to be included or excluded from the sidebar. Note that the site name/logo always links to the homepage. Default: True . prev_next_buttons_location : One of bottom , top , both , or none . Displays the \u201cNext\u201d and \u201cPrevious\u201d buttons accordingly. Default: bottom . navigation_depth : The maximum depth of the navigation tree in the sidebar. Default: 4 . collapse_navigation : Only include the page section headers in the sidebar for the current page. Default: True . titles_only : Only include page titles in the sidebar, excluding all section headers for all pages. Default: False . sticky_navigation : If True, causes the sidebar to scroll with the main page content as you scroll the page. Default: True . Third Party Themes \u00b6 A list of third party themes can be found in the MkDocs community wiki . If you have created your own, please feel free to add it to the list. Customizing a Theme \u00b6 If you would like to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, there is no need to create your own theme from scratch. For minor tweaks which only require some CSS and/or JavaScript, you can use the docs_dir . However, for more complex customizations, including overriding templates, you will need to use the theme custom_dir setting. Using the docs_dir \u00b6 The extra_css and extra_javascript configuration options can be used to make tweaks and customizations to existing themes. To use these, you simply need to include either CSS or JavaScript files within your documentation directory . For example, to change the colour of the headers in your documentation, create a file called extra.css and place it next to the documentation Markdown. In that file add the following CSS. h1 { color : red ; } Note If you are deploying your documentation with ReadTheDocs . You will need to explicitly list the CSS and JavaScript files you want to include in your config. To do this, add the following to your mkdocs.yml. extra_css: [extra.css] After making these changes, they should be visible when you run mkdocs serve - if you already had this running, you should see that the CSS changes were automatically picked up and the documentation will be updated. Note Any extra CSS or JavaScript files will be added to the generated HTML document after the page content. If you desire to include a JavaScript library, you may have better success including the library by using the theme custom_dir . Using the theme custom_dir \u00b6 The theme. custom_dir configuration option can be used to point to a directory of files which override the files in a parent theme. The parent theme would be the theme defined in the theme. name configuration option. Any file in the custom_dir with the same name as a file in the parent theme will replace the file of the same name in the parent theme. Any additional files in the custom_dir will be added to the parent theme. The contents of the custom_dir should mirror the directory structure of the parent theme. You may include templates, JavaScript files, CSS files, images, fonts, or any other media included in a theme. Note For this to work, the theme name setting must be set to a known installed theme. If the name setting is instead set to null (or not defined), then there is no theme to override and the contents of the custom_dir must be a complete, standalone theme. See Custom Themes for more information. For example, the mkdocs theme ( browse source ), contains the following directory structure (in part): - css\\ - fonts\\ - img\\ - favicon.ico - grid.png - js\\ - 404.html - base.html - content.html - nav-sub.html - nav.html - toc.html To override any of the files contained in that theme, create a new directory next to your docs_dir : mkdir custom_theme And then point your mkdocs.yml configuration file at the new directory: theme : name : mkdocs custom_dir : custom_theme/ To override the 404 error page (\"file not found\"), add a new template file named 404.html to the custom_theme directory. For information on what can be included in a template, review the documentation for building a custom theme . To override the favicon, you can add a new icon file at custom_theme/img/favicon.ico . To include a JavaScript library, copy the library to the custom_theme/js/ directory. Your directory structure should now look like this: - docs/ - index.html - custom_theme/ - img/ - favicon.ico - js/ - somelib.js - 404.html - config.yml Note Any files included in the parent theme (defined in name ) but not included in the custom_dir will still be utilized. The custom_dir will only override/replace files in the parent theme. If you want to remove files, or build a theme from scratch, then you should review the documentation for building a custom theme . Overriding Template Blocks \u00b6 The built-in themes implement many of their parts inside template blocks which can be individually overridden in the main.html template. Simply create a main.html template file in your custom_dir and define replacement blocks within that file. Just make sure that the main.html extends base.html . For example, to alter the title of the MkDocs theme, your replacement main.html template would contain the following: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Custom title goes here</title> {% endblock %} In the above example, the htmltitle block defined in your custom main.html file will be used in place of the default htmltitle block defined in the parent theme. You may re-define as many blocks as you desire, as long as those blocks are defined in the parent. For example, you could replace the Google Analytics script with one for a different service or replace the search feature with your own. You will need to consult the parent theme you are using to determine what blocks are available to override. The MkDocs and ReadTheDocs themes provide the following blocks: site_meta : Contains meta tags in the document head. htmltitle : Contains the page title in the document head. styles : Contains the link tags for stylesheets. libs : Contains the JavaScript libraries (jQuery, etc) included in the page header. scripts : Contains JavaScript scripts which should execute after a page loads. analytics : Contains the analytics script. extrahead : An empty block in the <head> to insert custom tags/scripts/etc. site_name : Contains the site name in the navigation bar. site_nav : Contains the site navigation in the navigation bar. search_button : Contains the search box in the navigation bar. next_prev : Contains the next and previous buttons in the navigation bar. repo : Contains the repository link in the navigation bar. content : Contains the page content and table of contents for the page. footer : Contains the page footer. You may need to view the source template files to ensure your modifications will work with the structure of the site. See Template Variables for a list of variables you can use within your custom blocks. For a more complete explanation of blocks, consult the Jinja documentation . Combining the custom_dir and Template Blocks \u00b6 Adding a JavaScript library to the custom_dir will make it available, but won't include it in the pages generated by MkDocs. Therefore, a link needs to be added to the library from the HTML. Starting the with directory structure above (truncated): - docs/ - custom_theme/ - js/ - somelib.js - config.yml A link to the custom_theme/js/somelib.js file needs to be added to the template. As somelib.js is a JavaScript library, it would logically go in the libs block. However, a new libs block that only includes the new script will replace the block defined in the parent template and any links to libraries in the parent template will be removed. To avoid breaking the template, a super block can be used with a call to super from within the block: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block libs %} {{ super () }} <script src=\" {{ base_url }} /js/somelib.js\"></script> {% endblock %} Note that the base_url template variable was used to ensure that the link is always relative to the current page. Now the generated pages will include links to the template provided libraries as well as the library included in the custom_dir . The same would be required for any additional CSS files included in the custom_dir .","title":"Styling your docs"},{"location":"user-guide/styling-your-docs/#styling-your-docs","text":"How to style and theme your documentation.

To use these, you simply need to include either CSS or JavaScript files within your documentation directory . For example, to change the colour of the headers in your documentation, create a file called extra.css and place it next to the documentation Markdown. In that file add the following CSS. h1 { color : red ; } Note If you are deploying your documentation with ReadTheDocs . You will need to explicitly list the CSS and JavaScript files you want to include in your config. To do this, add the following to your mkdocs.yml. extra_css: [extra.css] After making these changes, they should be visible when you run mkdocs serve - if you already had this running, you should see that the CSS changes were automatically picked up and the documentation will be updated. Note Any extra CSS or JavaScript files will be added to the generated HTML document after the page content. If you desire to include a JavaScript library, you may have better success including the library by using the theme custom_dir .","title":"Using the docs_dir"},{"location":"user-guide/styling-your-docs/#using-the-theme-custom_dir","text":"The theme. custom_dir configuration option can be used to point to a directory of files which override the files in a parent theme. The parent theme would be the theme defined in the theme. name configuration option. Any file in the custom_dir with the same name as a file in the parent theme will replace the file of the same name in the parent theme. Any additional files in the custom_dir will be added to the parent theme. The contents of the custom_dir should mirror the directory structure of the parent theme. You may include templates, JavaScript files, CSS files, images, fonts, or any other media included in a theme. Note For this to work, the theme name setting must be set to a known installed theme. If the name setting is instead set to null (or not defined), then there is no theme to override and the contents of the custom_dir must be a complete, standalone theme. See Custom Themes for more information. For example, the mkdocs theme ( browse source ), contains the following directory structure (in part): - css\\ - fonts\\ - img\\ - favicon.ico - grid.png - js\\ - 404.html - base.html - content.html - nav-sub.html - nav.html - toc.html To override any of the files contained in that theme, create a new directory next to your docs_dir : mkdir custom_theme And then point your mkdocs.yml configuration file at the new directory: theme : name : mkdocs custom_dir : custom_theme/ To override the 404 error page (\"file not found\"), add a new template file named 404.html to the custom_theme directory. For information on what can be included in a template, review the documentation for building a custom theme . To override the favicon, you can add a new icon file at custom_theme/img/favicon.ico . To include a JavaScript library, copy the library to the custom_theme/js/ directory. Your directory structure should now look like this: - docs/ - index.html - custom_theme/ - img/ - favicon.ico - js/ - somelib.js - 404.html - config.yml Note Any files included in the parent theme (defined in name ) but not included in the custom_dir will still be utilized. The custom_dir will only override/replace files in the parent theme. If you want to remove files, or build a theme from scratch, then you should review the documentation for building a custom theme .","title":"Using the theme custom_dir"},{"location":"user-guide/styling-your-docs/#overriding-template-blocks","text":"The built-in themes implement many of their parts inside template blocks which can be individually overridden in the main.html template. Simply create a main.html template file in your custom_dir and define replacement blocks within that file. Just make sure that the main.html extends base.html . For example, to alter the title of the MkDocs theme, your replacement main.html template would contain the following: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Custom title goes here</title> {% endblock %} In the above example, the htmltitle block defined in your custom main.html file will be used in place of the default htmltitle block defined in the parent theme. You may re-define as many blocks as you desire, as long as those blocks are defined in the parent. For example, you could replace the Google Analytics script with one for a different service or replace the search feature with your own. You will need to consult the parent theme you are using to determine what blocks are available to override. The MkDocs and ReadTheDocs themes provide the following blocks: site_meta : Contains meta tags in the document head. htmltitle : Contains the page title in the document head. styles : Contains the link tags for stylesheets. libs : Contains the JavaScript libraries (jQuery, etc) included in the page header. scripts : Contains JavaScript scripts which should execute after a page loads. analytics : Contains the analytics script. extrahead : An empty block in the <head> to insert custom tags/scripts/etc. site_name : Contains the site name in the navigation bar. site_nav : Contains the site navigation in the navigation bar. search_button : Contains the search box in the navigation bar. next_prev : Contains the next and previous buttons in the navigation bar. repo : Contains the repository link in the navigation bar. content : Contains the page content and table of contents for the page. footer : Contains the page footer. You may need to view the source template files to ensure your modifications will work with the structure of the site. See Template Variables for a list of variables you can use within your custom blocks. For a more complete explanation of blocks, consult the Jinja documentation .","title":"Overriding Template Blocks"},{"location":"user-guide/styling-your-docs/#combining-the-custom_dir-and-template-blocks","text":"Adding a JavaScript library to the custom_dir will make it available, but won't include it in the pages generated by MkDocs. Therefore, a link needs to be added to the library from the HTML. Starting the with directory structure above (truncated): - docs/ - custom_theme/ - js/ - somelib.js - config.yml A link to the custom_theme/js/somelib.js file needs to be added to the template. As somelib.js is a JavaScript library, it would logically go in the libs block. However, a new libs block that only includes the new script will replace the block defined in the parent template and any links to libraries in the parent template will be removed. To avoid breaking the template, a super block can be used with a call to super from within the block: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block libs %} {{ super () }} <script src=\" {{ base_url }} /js/somelib.js\"></script> {% endblock %} Note that the base_url template variable was used to ensure that the link is always relative to the current page.
