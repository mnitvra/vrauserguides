Reporting an Issue \u00b6 Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and MkDocs version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please add a screenshot and if you get an error please include the full error and traceback. Testing the Development Version \u00b6 If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of MkDocs you can do so with the following command. This can be useful if you want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you have encountered is fixed in the git master. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv . pip install https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/archive/master.tar.gz Installing for Development \u00b6 First you'll need to fork and clone the repository. Once you have a local copy, run the following command. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv . pip install --editable . This will install MkDocs in development mode which binds the mkdocs command to the git repository. Running the tests \u00b6 To run the tests, it is recommended that you use tox . Install Tox using pip by running the command pip install tox . Then the test suite can be run for MkDocs by running the command tox in the root of your MkDocs repository. It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we support. So don't be concerned if you are missing some and they fail. The rest will be verified by Travis when you submit a pull request. Submitting Pull Requests \u00b6 Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request.

Console access in vRA includes the ability to direct console into a server and perform several other power cycle related functions. Console access is equivalent to a direct console session into a server and does not use RDP protocols. Console access through vRA will give access to a server if it's locked or otherwise inaccessible. Everyone on the Virtualization, Windows and Unix support teams has default console access in place. Access for other MNIT enterprise and agency support customers is created as needed. Prerequisites \u00b6 Access to vRA Virtualization, Windows, and Unix Teams have default console access to all virtual machines in all agencies. Other staff that need vRA console access may notify the virtualizaion team via a general work order to request or verify access. Must have a State.mn.gov PA account. Basic Console Actions \u00b6 Connect to Remote Console Shutdown Reboot Power On *Power Cycle *Power Off *These are forced power actions and will ungracefully power cycle a virtual machine. Use only when a server is unresponsive to other troubleshooting methods and you cannot access the console due to a probable server lock up. Make sure you are 113% sure you are on the right server! 'Shutdown' and 'Reboot' will interact with VMTools on the server to gracefully power cycle if VMTools is installed to the server. Appliances and other special case machines may not have VMTools. If you are not sure, use Connect to Remote Console and initiate a shutdown from the console . Action Definitions (Only basic actions listed above are available in vRA for basic access. Select teams and users may have access to more actions). Procedure \u00b6 LOGON to vRA. DEPLOYMENTS tab. CLEAR FILTER by selecting the filter icon. CLEAR ALL . SEARCH for server in the 'Search for deployments by...' search box. SELECT the deployment name. Servers are listed under deployments and not directly in the deployment tab. SELECT the server name under the deployment name on the left. SELECT the gear icon pull down just to the right of the server name. SELECT Connect to Remote Console . A new tab should appear with the server console screen. Windows - SEND CTRL+ALT+DEL Linux - Begin interacting with console screen. Other power cycle actions can be used as needed in Step 8 but procede with caution as you'll be taking a server offline. Notes \u00b6 Power Cycle Warning \u00b6 It is recommended to reboot a server from its console and use the power cycle actions as a last ditch step when troubleshooting an unresponsive server. Clear Filter Tip \u00b6 You'll need to clear the filter each time when coming into a new vRA session and viewing the deployments tab. If you don't clear the filter, vRA will only show machines that you have deployed and your search won't find what you are looking for in most cases. Yes, it's annoying and we can't change the UI. CD/ISO drive mounting limitation and workaround \u00b6 There is no current capability to mount ISO files to a server using vRA console access. Workaround RDP directly to the server with RDP 'Local Resources' enabled to show your local disk drives on the remote RDP server. Copy the ISO file to the server's local disk and mount it there.","title":"Console Access Getting Started"},{"location":"user-guide/console/#vra-virtual-machine-console-getting-started","text":"","title":"vRA Virtual Machine Console Getting Started"},{"location":"user-guide/console/#description","text":"Accessing and using the virtual machine console functions.

Why is MNIT using vRA? A. To distribute access to provision MNIT Cloud infrastructure resources by providing a self-service portal to internal and external customers. To minimized delays in resource provisioning by automating repetivive and error prone processes. vRA serves as a central coordinating hub between several previously isolated technologies such as IPAM (IP management), backups, patching, Ansible, and Microsoft AD integrations. By automating much of the provision process, requests are fullfilled faster and in a standardized manner while abstracting the complex back end infrastructure that was previously handled only by a narrow scope of experienced staff. Q. Can we have access to vCenter for MNIT Cloud? A. No. Industry best practice is to not distribute access to virtual machines via vCenter for security and operational reasons. RDP and vRA VM Console access are available for MNIT Cloud virtual machine access. Q. MNIT Cloud vs SDDC? A. MNIT Cloud used to be called SDDC. SDDC is a generic term for software defined datacenter. Q. What is a blueprint? A. A vRA blueprint is a set of design instructions and deployment form that allow for delivering the provisioning of new virtual infrastrucure resources. Q. Future direction of vRA? A. VM provisioning access opened up to the MNIT Windows and Unix teams with access being given to select agency customers at an as yet undermined date. vRA 8 is the next major new release of vRA and represents a top down full architectural software overhaul. Essentially a brand new 1.0 product. Development is currently in progress interally with a 2021 release planned for MNIT. Add a link to vRA 8 info Q. What are the new server naming restrictions? A. The automation infrastructure requires the Windows server naming agency code prefix (first 3 characters) to match the corresponding domain the server is joined to. For example, if a server needs to be in the admin.state.mn.us domain, its name will begin with G02. Even if MNIT (G46) is requesting it. Billing is not tied to the server name. Any charge code can be applied to any server as needed so MNIT enterprise can still be billed for agency customer domain machines they request. Q. How long do provision requests take? A. Windows: 15-25 minutes RHEL/OEL: 12-20 minutes","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"user-guide/glossary/","text":"Glossary \u00b6 Business Group \u00b6 vRA contruct to seperate logical business units within an organization.
