The MkDocs project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of ways, a few examples are: Code patches via pull requests Documentation improvements Bug reports and patch reviews Code of Conduct \u00b6 Everyone interacting in the MkDocs project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the PyPA Code of Conduct . Reporting an Issue \u00b6 Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and MkDocs version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please add a screenshot and if you get an error please include the full error and traceback. Testing the Development Version \u00b6 If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of MkDocs you can do so with the following command. This can be useful if you want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you have encountered is fixed in the git master. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv . pip install https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/archive/master.tar.gz Installing for Development \u00b6 First you'll need to fork and clone the repository. Once you have a local copy, run the following command. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv . pip install --editable . This will install MkDocs in development mode which binds the mkdocs command to the git repository. Running the tests \u00b6 To run the tests, it is recommended that you use tox . Install Tox using pip by running the command pip install tox . Then the test suite can be run for MkDocs by running the command tox in the root of your MkDocs repository. It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we support. So don't be concerned if you are missing some and they fail. The rest will be verified by Travis when you submit a pull request. Submitting Pull Requests \u00b6 Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.","title":"Comments/Suggestions"},{"location":"about/contributing/#contributing-to-mkdocs","text":"An introduction to contributing to the MkDocs project.
